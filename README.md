# 🚀 100xDevs Cohort 0–100 Journey

This repository documents my learning journey through the **[100xDevs Cohort (0–100)](https://harkirat.classx.co.in/new-courses/8-live-0-100-complete)**.  
Alongside the structured topics covered in the course, I also build **small projects** to better understand concepts, practice coding, and experiment on my own.

- ✅ practice from **100xDevs Cohort lectures**
- 🛠️ **Mini-projects** I created while exploring topics
